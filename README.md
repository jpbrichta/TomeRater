Cohort: PWP June 19 2018

A project submitted to complete Codecademy Pro "Programming with Python" course.

TomeRater.py is the required solution code.

populate.py is the unit test code provided with the project. I have modified this file to test the new functions.

TomeRater instructions.pdf are instructions for the assignment (for completeness and if I ever look back at this code).
